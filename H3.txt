Homework #H3: Implement RRT

Due: March 27, 11:59PM (two weeks, due to spring break)

Upload to Canvas

Each student does their own assignment.

You get:

A CSV file containing 2-D disc-like workspace obstacles of the form
x, y, radius
Problems of the form
start location (x, y)
goal region (x, y, radius)
Extension distance (epsilon)
You turn in (zip file):
A graphical representation of the paths that were calculated moving through the workspace (including obstacles)
Your code
Note: H3, H4, and H5 will be a progression. In particular, in H3 and H4 we will extend this code to using non-trivial robots. So... design your code with that in mind.
For all problems use the obstacle file called
"obstacles.txt"

IMPORTANT NOTE: the configuration space is from 0 to 100 in x and
0 to 100 in y. In other words, using geometric set notation:
S = [0 100] X [0 100]
You must constrain your sampling to be from
within the space S.


For each of the following problems you will turn in a 
graphical representation of the paths that were calculated 
moving through the workspace (including drawing obstacles).

Don't forget: you also need to include this with your code in a zip file.


Here are the problems:

----------------------
Problem 1:

start (x,y):  [75,85]
goal region (x,y,radius) = [100 0 20]
epsilon = 10


---------------------

Problem 2:

start (x,y):  [20,10]
goal region (x,y,radius) = [75 85 10]
epsilon = 5


---------------------

Problem 3:

start (x,y):  [60,60]
goal region (x,y,radius) = [90 100 20]
epsilon = 5


---------------------

Problem 4:

start (x,y):  [60 80]
goal region (x,y,radius) = [60 60 5]
epsilon = 5


---------------------

Problem 5:

start (x,y):  [1 99]
goal region (x,y,radius) = [100 0 20]
epsilon = 1
